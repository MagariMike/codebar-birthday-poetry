      <h1>Poetry in Motion</h1>
      <p>This is a project for codebar Brighton's 10th anniversary.</p>
      <h2>Git your poetry on track!</h2>
      <p>
        Codebar Brighton’s 10 years old A birthday party we will hold We’ll
        celebrate with cake and wine And Github skills and fun till nine In
        groups you’ll write some CSS Your code is certain to impress More
        couplets too, to fill it out Some cheesy rhyming without doubt A Github
        branch you will create In [twenty] minutes; don’t be late Then submit a
        Pull Request Watch carefully while we do the rest… So, what does codebar
        mean to you? To hosts we say a big thankyou Our awesome coaches we adore
        Our students couldn’t ask for more
      </p>
      <p>
        For each codeBar in 10 years, Add some pizza and some beers, Gather
        coaches and a host, Return a project for which to boost
      </p>
      <p>
        At codebar, we learn and grow, With pizza, friends, and skills to show,
        Networking helps our futures glow, New job opportunities flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        10 years sounds like a lot,<br />
        but if you are coding in binary it's really not.<br />
        Javascript libaries may come and go,<br />
        but codebar will keep you in the know.
      </p>
      <p>and now we've saved the best for last,</p>
      <p>hip hip horray for 10 years past.</p>
      <p>off to the pub we go,</p>
      <p>thank you for putting on an amazing show.</p>
